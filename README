# Audio2MIDI

This is a small project to convert features of audio signals into MIDI data. 

An example usage would be to use the amplitude of an audio signal to control the volume of a synth. Used with a microphone, this would provide breath control.

The project is written in SuperCollider (http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/).

I am only testing on OS X (Snow Leopard).
